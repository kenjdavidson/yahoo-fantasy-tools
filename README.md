# Yahoo Fantasy Tools

Provide extended tools for Yahoo Fantasy commissioners and players.

## Commissioner

Commissioner tools include:

### Keeper Tools

Provide an external set of tools and reports for managing leagues with extended keeper rules.  Other league providers (CBS and NFL for example) provide an extended set of keeper rules that Yahoo doesn't support.  This makes managing your team 

#### Keep Maximum Years

Leagues may implement a rule:

- Keepers may only be kept for a maximum of `X` years.  After which they will be returned to the free agent pool.  This is a more popular option in a number of my newer leagues and it is difficult (annoying) to manage manually.

#### Keep Minimum Draft Last Year

- Keepers may only be kept from players drafter after the `X` round from last year.

### Draft Tools

#### Draft Lottery

Some leagues (hockey) may provide an NHL like lottery for the first pick (or all lower picks).  Draft Lottery tool allows you to configure the number of ballots per team (based on finish position) and the picks which will be made during the lottery.  For example:

| Place | Ballots |
| --- | --- |
| 12 | 50 |
| 11 | 35 |
| 10 | 25 |
| 9 | 20 |
| 8 | 15 |
| 7 | 10 |
| 6 | 5 |

where rules could include:

- First pick lottery the rest finish position
- Top 3 picks lottery the rest finish position
